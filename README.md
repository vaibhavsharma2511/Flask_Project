For this assignment, I developed a regression machine learning model to predict fish weight based on their physical characteristics using the Fish Market dataset. The model, trained on features like species, length, height, and width. After successful training, the model was serialized and a Flask API was created to serve predictions. A HTML frontend was designed for input, and the entire application was deployed on Heroku. This allows users to input fish dimensions through a web interface and receive real-time weight predictions, demonstrating practical application of regression techniques and cloud deployment.
